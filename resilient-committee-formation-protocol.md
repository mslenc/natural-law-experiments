# Resilient Committee Formation Protocol

## Preamble:

To ensure the continuous operation of competent, legitimate, and 
corruption-resistant decision-making bodies across all institutional
domains, the following protocol provides a stratified, testifiable, 
and recursively terminating method for committee formation that 
satisfies the criteria of decidability, incentive alignment, 
institutional memory, and resistance to capture or obstruction.

## 0. Formal Parameters:

* `COMMITTEE_SIZE`: Number of members in the final committee. Must be a multiple of 3. (Default: 6)
* `IS_ELIGIBLE`: Function that determines whether an individual is eligible to participate.
  Must be defined explicitly and categorically, and must select a sufficient number of people
  for the Institutional Roster size to be large enough.
  (Example: individual holds senior-enough status in the organization.)
* `EXPERIENCE`: Function used for ranking individuals in the candidate roster.
  (Default: number of prior successful participations in the same class of projects; tiebreaker:
  length of continuous participation (e.g. employment) in the institution.)
* `INITIAL_POOL_MULTIPLIER`: Multiplier for determining the size of the initial candidate list,
  relative to `COMMITTEE_SIZE`. Must be at least 2 to allow for fully voluntary participation.
  (Default: 3)
* `IS_CRISIS`: Boolean flag indicating if the protocol is being invoked for high-stakes or
  failure contexts. Tweaks certain operations, see details below. (Default: false)
* `PUNISH_HEAD`: Consequence for institutional head failure. Defaults to resignation with 
  public admonishment if `IS_CRISIS`; must otherwise be specified. May be null outside 
  public institutions.
* `PUNISH_OTHER`: Consequence for refusal by selected participants. Defaults to resignation
  if `IS_CRISIS`; must otherwise be specified. May be null outside public institutions.
* `HEAD`: Designated individual responsible for executing the protocol. If `IS_CRISIS` and
  in context of public institutions, this must be the head of the institution; this is also
  the default when `IS_CRISIS` is false.

## I. Structure of Tiered  Roster:

1. To begin, an Institutional Roster is produced, containing all `IS_ELIGIBLE` individuals 
   within the institution.

2. The Institutional Roster is sorted by descending `EXPERIENCE`.

3. Based on this ordered list, the roster is stratified into three performance-weighted tiers:

    * First Tier: Top 15% of ranked individuals.
    * Second Tier: Next 35%.
    * Third Tier: Remaining 50%.

4. The three Tiers together form the Tiered Roster.

5. The `EXPERIENCE` function must be:
    * Operationally defined via participation logs and evaluation metrics.
    * Publicly auditable and warrantable where institutional transparency is required (e.g. public bodies).

##  II. Randomized Stratified Selection:

1. A Tiered Candidate Pool is formed by randomly selecting
   `(INITIAL_POOL_MULTIPLIER * COMMITTEE_SIZE / 3)` people from each Roster Tier,
   maintaining equal representation across tiers.
    * With default parameters this means selecting 18 individuals: 6 from each Roster Tier.

3. From these candidates, voluntary participation is sought during the next phase.

4. Final committee composition need not include equal numbers from each tier,
   but must include at least one member from each.

## III. Voluntary Formation Phase:

1. Candidates from all tiers are first offered the option to participate voluntarily.

2. If more than the required number of candidates agree to participate,
   final members are selected randomly from among the volunteers.
    * Within each tier, all candidates have equal selection probability.
    * Tier balance is preferred, therefore selection is done the following way:
      while the total number of people is too large, one is removed randomly
      from the tier that has the most candidates. In case of tie, less
      experienced tiers get precedence (for candidate removal).
    * For each tier that has no volunteers, the final total number in previous step
      is reduced by 1, to leave room for a coerced candidate selected in the next phase.
    * A few examples with default parameters (initial distribution -> final distribution)
        * 1/2/6 -> 1/2/3
        * 3/4/5 -> 2/2/2
        * 3/0/5 -> 3/0/2

3. If each tier is represented and the total number of people is
   at least `COMMITTEE_SIZE`, the committee is deemed valid and
   process stops, with no coercion necessary.

## IV. Coercive Fallback Phase:

1. While the committee has fewer than `COMMITTEE_SIZE` individuals,
   a person is added to the committee by repeating these steps:
    1. Select target tier by least representation, preferring less
       experienced tiers in case of tie.
    2. If `IS_CRISIS` and `HEAD` is not yet in the committee, select `HEAD`.
    3. Otherwise, randomly select a person from the target tier.
    4. Add the selected person to the committee as representing the target tier.

2. If a person refuses cooperation, this triggers `PUNISH_HEAD` for `HEAD`,
   and `PUNISH_OTHER` otherwise. The person is removed from the committee
   and another person is added using the same selection process (IV.1).

    1. If a tier is exhausted, the entire remaining candidate pool is used instead.
    2. If the candidate pool is exhausted, the entire roster is used instead.
    3. If the roster is exhausted and there still aren't `COMMITTEE_SIZE` people
       willing or able to cooperate, the protocol has failed. If the organization
       is a public institution:
        1. If `IS_CRISIS`, the organization is declared defunct and disbanded.
            1. This may be challenged in court for inappropriate use of `IS_CRISIS`.
               If successful, the person responsible for declaring it is punished instead.
        2. Otherwise, `HEAD` and every person in first tier of roster is resigned
           for failing to uphold institutional performance.
            1. This may be challenged in court on the grounds that the project in
               question failed to meet the minimum institutional standards for
               scope, clarity, or feasibility, such that refusal to participate
               constituted a reasonable professional judgment rather than dereliction.
               If successful, the responsibility reverts to the `HEAD` for initiating
               the protocol on an unfit project.

3. A person may refuse cooperation without penalty, as a narrow exception to
   the refusal penalty clause (IV.2.), if they have justified, testifiable and
   reciprocal grounds to do so, provided such grounds are declared at the time of refusal.
    1. These include: legal disqualification, conflict of interest, medical infirmity,
       prior contractual obligations, institutional recusal, judicial suspension and
       emergency status.
    2. Other grounds may be permissible if successfully defended in court as justified,
       testifiable, and reciprocal under the institutional constraints at the time of refusal.

## V. Implementation Constraints:

1. The protocol assumes institutional access to structured participation data to
   compute eligibility, experience, and committee composition.
2. Formal parameters such as `IS_ELIGIBLE`, `EXPERIENCE`, and tier membership must be 
   computable, deterministic, and independently auditable.
3. Institutions must establish verifiable internal procedures to record, update, 
   and make queryable the data needed for protocol execution.
4. Deployment requires a rule-bound execution environment—manual or automated—that 
   eliminates discretionary override.
5. Test and simulation procedures should be conducted prior to formal use, to 
   guarantee determinism and prevent deadlocks under various edge conditions.

## Protocol Benefits:

* **Fosters competence development and institutional memory maintenance**:
  mandatory inclusion of lower tiers promotes renewal, learning, and long-term resilience.
  
* **Promotes meritocratic competence while resisting elite capture**:
  structured weighting toward experienced members rewards demonstrated 
  contribution, while limiting overconcentration and ensuring broad 
  access to participation.
  
* **Prevents strategic obstruction** by ensuring process completion
  regardless of cooperation, via coercive fallback and guaranteed termination.
  
* **Builds legitimacy** through testifiable, rule-bound, and warrantable
  procedure, with voluntary cooperation as the structurally preferred
  path to committee formation. 

* **Applicable across all domains of structured group decision-making** -
  including public institutions (e.g., tribunals, constitutional juries),
  internal corporate governance (e.g., strategic review boards, compliance panels),
  civil associations (e.g., citizen juries, advisory councils), scientific
  institutions (e.g., replication tribunals, research ethics boards), and
  any context requiring durable, anti-capture committee formation
  under variable cooperation conditions.

## Summary:

This mechanism operationalizes meritocratic turnover, anti-capture defense,
and competence succession within institutional committees. It aligns incentives,
removes discretion, and guarantees either committee formation or exposure of
institutional failure, under both cooperative and adversarial conditions.

To be referenced by: Dialectical Tribunal Protocol, Institutional Audit 
Protocol, Crisis Response Governance, and any context requiring repeatable, 
rule-bound formation of institutional committees under bounded rationality
and risk of strategic obstruction, including crisis conditions.
