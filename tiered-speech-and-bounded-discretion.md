**Title:**
On the Necessity of a Stratified Model of Speech in Natural Law

**Context:**
Curt Doolittle's work defines truth as that which survives adversarial 
testing in operational terms, and requires all actionable public speech 
to be testimonial: operationally expressible, falsifiable, and warrantable
under liability. This standard is necessary for institutional trust, 
legal consistency, and decidability under asymmetry.

However, as a side effect, Natural Law as originally formulated excludes 
discretionary institutions from institutional legitimacy due to their lack
of testimonial constraint—even though such institutions have historically
produced high civilizational returns—particularly in domains of skill, 
innovation, and productive uncertainty. This strict filtering also 
suppresses potentially valuable signals—such as those likely to lead to 
testifiable discovery or coordination—simply because they cannot yet be
expressed in testimonial form.

**Problem:**
The current framework lacks a formal structure for:

* Exploratory speech (e.g., hunches, intuitions, pattern recognition);
* Proto-testimonial speech (e.g., plausible but unfalsified conjectures);
* Narrative or metaphorical speech (e.g., heuristic cultural knowledge).

This absence leads to over-constraining of speech in domains where:

* Innovation begins before operational formalization;
* Informal cooperation occurs without adversarial validation;
* Cultural evolution preserves non-operational but adaptive knowledge.

**Proposal:**
Introduce a three-tier speech classification (note that Tier 1 and 2 both
have conditions attached, specified below):

1. **Exploratory Speech:**

   * Non-operational, non-falsifiable.
   * Disclaims warranty: "This is not a claim, just an intuition."
     For example: "I can't quite explain why, but this feels very
     promising to me. If you're looking for research ideas and
     accept the risk of relying on my intuition to be correct, I
     offer it as a research direction you can take."
   * Admissible for bounded-domain discourse, research, or early coordination.

2. **Proto-Testimonial Speech:**

   * Operationally gestural, partially testable.
   * Signals intent to develop something pre-testimonial to
     testimonial, contingent upon success of validation. For
     example: "Our early tests show results we find intriguing
     and potentially very valuable, but we haven't yet determined
     replicability or causal relationships. We request funding
     for further research, but it is too soon to specify its form
     explicitly (it is itself one of the things to be discovered),
     or to make any claims, except that we will use the funds to
     the best of our ability to explore the phenomenon further
     and possibly derive (tier 3) claims."
   * Requires hedged language and scope limitation.

3. **Testimonial Speech:**

   * Fully operational, falsifiable, and warrantable.
   * Admissible for institutional decisions, contracts, and law.

**Mechanism of Integration:**

* Speech that doesn't include explicit disclaimers of lower
  epistemic status cannot be considered to be either Tier 1
  or Tier 2, except if such a disclaimer is implicit in the
  venue of discourse. Claims about this implicit disclaimer
  having been present in a venue must be testimonial.
* It remains undisputed that only testimonial (tier 3) speech
  can be used as justification for imposing coercive costs or
  claiming institutional authority.
* Exploratory and proto-testimonial speech count as admissible
  (for non-coercive justification) only if all of the following
  conditions are satisfied:

    1. **Bounded Domain of Skill or Experience**:
       *The speech pertains to a domain where:*
        *(a) its productive outputs exist and are voluntarily adopted for functional or coordinative use,*
        *(b) those outputs have observable and durable effects on behavior or production, and*
        *(c) those effects can be retroactively audited against the domain’s declared aims, which must themselves be functional, coordinative, or productive.*

    2. **Intent to Explore or Investigate**:
       The speaker disclaims certainty and positions the
       speech as directional, intuitive, or
       provisional—not assertive.

    3. **No Normative Assertions**:
       The speech does not prescribe obligations,
       duties, fairness, or what ought to be done
       outside the bounded domain.

    4. **No Appeal to Coercion**:
       The speech is not used, implicitly or explicitly,
       to justify policy, coercive institutional mandates,
       or redistribution.

**Amendment Clause B: On Liability Boundaries under Invalid Audience Epistemic Inference**

Tier 1 and 2 speech is vulnerable to epistemic parasitism: where
a recipient seeks reputational, legal, or institutional advantage
by asserting misunderstanding of the epistemic status of the speech.

To prevent such inversion of liability, the speaker is explicitly
protected from claims of misrepresentation, when their speech is 
determined to be admissible under conditions specified above.

If these conditions are satisfied, any downstream misinterpretation 
or cost is the responsibility of the recipient—because such 
consequences were incurred voluntarily and with warranty explicitly
having been withdrawn.

(Example: A recipient says: "I know he said he's not claiming 
anything, but we all know disclaimers are just filler to avoid
responsibility. He also implied he can make it work if we just 
give him the money. But he was lying, and I want my money back,
and I want him punished." 
This constitutes an attempt to extract liability from 
non-testimonial speech by a) dismissing explicit disclaimers,
and b) inventing replacement claims not actually made)

**Amendment Clause C: On Institutional Boundary of Discretionary Speech**

Discretionary non-testimonial speech—though inadmissible for
coercive action—remains indispensable for productive domains 
of uncertain knowledge. Not all knowledge is immediately 
operationalizable; not all expertise is fully articulable. 
Natural Law’s strict testimonial standard ensures decidability,
but rigid pre-specification via rules also risks eliminating
generative domains that cannot yet meet testimonial criteria.

Accordingly, discretionary institutions may be permitted—but 
only under conditions that neutralize both coercive and 
extractive risk. These institutions serve as structurally 
constrained zones of discretionary judgment operating 
under epistemic uncertainty: they may facilitate activity 
justified by exploratory or proto-testimonial speech, 
but are fully decoupled from coercive power and tax-based 
funding.

Such institutions must satisfy the following:

* Fully voluntary funding, with public disclosure of
  all funding sources exceeding a defined threshold;
* Recurring support permitted only if each commitment
  includes not only an amount and period of funding
  (e.g. \$150 monthly), but also an expiration date,
  where the total duration of payments does not exceed
  a maximum defined in legislation (e.g. 5 years);
  indefinite or open-ended funding is prohibited;
* Explicit public rationale for decisions, with
  named and accountable authorship;
* Transparent governance with publicly traceable
  decisions and their epistemic justifications;
* These constraints ensure the institution persists
  only while producing demonstrated value, as judged
  by the continuing voluntary support of its donors.

These conditions preserve sovereignty, prevent 
epistemic capture, and contain the effects of untestable speech.
They are not exceptions to Natural Law’s constraint, but 
engineered outlets—allowing innovation to proceed without
otherwise corrupting institutional legitimacy.

Institutions and donors may state the fact of funding, 
but must not use that fact to imply epistemic legitimacy,
moral superiority, or testimonial standing. Claims derived
from funding must be independently warranted. Use of 
funding as rhetorical or reputational leverage constitutes 
illicit circumvention of testimonial constraints.

**Consequences:**

* Preserves the rigor and constraint of testimonial logic
  within the coercively funded public domain.
* Avoids epistemic parasitism by requiring transparency of
  speech type.
* Enables Natural Law to model the full epistemic lifecycle
  without compromising decidability.
* Aligns with the evolutionary computation model underpinning
  the framework, which depends on mutation, drift, and selection.

**Conclusion:** 

This amendment does not challenge the validity of testimonial 
speech as a normative standard for institutional legitimacy. 
Instead, it introduces the necessary scaffolding for Natural 
Law to scale to all phases of truth formation, without 
sacrificing precision, reciprocity, or sovereignty.
